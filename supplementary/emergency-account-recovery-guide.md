*Special Section for Relationship Conflicts and Account Recovery*

## **IMMEDIATE SIGNS YOUR ACCOUNT IS HACKED**
✓ Friends/family ask "Why did you send me that message?" [41][43]
✓ You get locked out of your email or Google account
✓ People say you're sending strange links or requests [51]
✓ Your contacts receive messages you didn't send
✓ Relationship conflicts from "your" messages [41][43]

## **DON'T PANIC - THIS IS FIXABLE**
- **It's NOT your fault** - hackers steal 3.2 billion passwords yearly [13][16]
- **Google helps people recover accounts daily** [3][6][47]
- **Your relationships can be repaired** with honest communication

## **STEP 1: RECOVER YOUR ACCOUNT (5-10 minutes)**
1. **Go to g.co/recover** on any device [3][42][44][47]
2. **Enter your email address** that was hacked
3. **Try your last remembered password** [47]
4. **If that doesn't work, click "Try another way"** [47]
5. **Use your phone number** for verification code [47]
6. **Answer questions as best you can** - guess if unsure [47]
7. **Create a NEW, STRONG password** when prompted

### **Recovery Tips:**
- **Use a familiar device/location** if possible [47]
- **Don't skip questions** - guess rather than skip [47]
- **Be patient** - it may take a few tries
- **Check spam folder** for Google recovery emails [47]

## **STEP 2: SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT (5 minutes)**
1. **Change password immediately** [43][48]
2. **Sign out of all devices** [43][48]
3. **Set up 2-factor authentication** [21][27]
4. **Check recent activity** for suspicious logins
5. **Update recovery phone/email** [18]

## **STEP 3: REPAIR RELATIONSHIPS (Important!)**

### **Sample Message to Send Friends/Family:**
*"Hi everyone - my Google/email account was hacked yesterday. If you received any strange messages from me, please ignore them. It wasn't me sending those messages. I've recovered my account and changed my password. I'm sorry for any confusion this caused. - [Your name]"*

### **For WhatsApp Groups:**
*"Familia - someone hacked my account and may have sent fake messages. Please ignore anything suspicious you got from me. My account is secure now. Thanks for understanding."*

### **For Close Family Members:**
- **Call them directly** to explain what happened
- **Be honest**: "My account was hacked, those weren't my messages"
- **Reassure them**: "I'm taking steps so this won't happen again"
- **Thank them** for understanding and patience

## **STEP 4: PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN**

### **Set Up These 3 Protections:**
1. **Google Password Manager** [2][5][11]
   - Settings → Google → Autofill → Passwords
   - Let Google create strong, unique passwords

2. **Two-Factor Authentication** [21][27][33]
   - Download Google Authenticator app
   - Add to all important accounts (email, bank, social media)

3. **Regular Security Checkups** [28][34]
   - Monthly: Review recent account activity
   - Remove unused app permissions
   - Check for unfamiliar devices/logins

## **WARNING SIGNS TO WATCH FOR**
- **Messages you didn't send** appearing in your sent folder [43]
- **Login notifications** from unfamiliar locations
- **Friends asking about messages** they received from you [41]
- **Changes to your account settings** you didn't make [48]
- **Apps or devices** you don't recognize connected to your account

## **COMMUNITY SUPPORT RESOURCES**

### **Who to Contact:**
- **Trusted family member** who can help with technology
- **Community tech supporter** from this training
- **Local library** for computer/internet access
- **WhatsApp support group** from this training session

### **What NOT to Do:**
❌ Don't pay anyone claiming they can "fix" your account faster
❌ Don't give your password to anyone offering to help
❌ Don't ignore the problem hoping it goes away
❌ Don't assume your relationships are permanently damaged

### **Documentation Concerns:**
- **Account recovery is legal and normal** - Google expects people to recover hacked accounts
- **Use your real information** during recovery - lying makes it harder
- **Keep recovery information current** - outdated phone numbers slow recovery [18]
